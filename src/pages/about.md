      <p class="text-stone-700">
        In the heart of Negaunee lies Old Town, a place rich with history and personal significance for us. Old Town Cheese is more than just a store; it’s a tribute to a cherished part of our lives and a celebration of fine, artisanal foods.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-ironRed mb-2">A Love Story and a Shared Passion</h2>
      <p class="text-stone-700">
        Our story begins over 20 years ago, when we, Kelsi and Michael, met in high school. Our bond grew stronger over the years, nurtured by shared adventures and a mutual love for good food. One of our favorite pastimes was sneaking into the fenced-off area of Old Town, a section of the city that was slowly closed off over the course of several decades due to mining and unstable ground. Among the abandoned foundations and overgrown paths, we found a special place that became a cornerstone of our relationship.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-ironRed mb-2">A Tribute to Old Town</h2>
      <p class="text-stone-700">
        Old Town holds a deep personal significance for us. Kelsi’s relatives lived and went to school there before it was closed, adding another layer of connection. When Old Town was reopened and transformed into a beautiful park several years ago, it became a symbol of renewal and community for us and for the city.
