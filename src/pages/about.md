  <p class="mb-4">
    Old Town Cheese was born out of a love for simple pleasures â€” good cheese, fresh bread, and 
    community. We're just getting started, but our mission is clear: bring a little joy to your day, 
    one charcuterie cup at a time.

    Our ingredients are thoughtfully sourced, and our aesthetic? Comfortably rustic with a hint of flair.
